	/*! This class holds all the information that is required to verify application instance certificates.
	*
	* A certificate can be signed (issued) by another certificate. In general the issuer is a certificate authority (CA)
	* but for special use cases non-CA certificates can also sign other certificates.
	* Every issued certificate can be revoked by the signer, e.g. in case of a compromised private key.
	* Revoked certificates are stored in a Certificate Revocation List (CRL) and shall be rejected on validation.
	*
	* Root certificates are signed by themselves, they are named self-signed. Both self-signed and issued certificates
	* can be used as application instance certificate. In case of many instance certificates it might be easier to deploy
	* only the CA certificates (and their CRLs).
	*
	* General certificate handling:
	*
	* A OPC UA application provides its application certificate via the Application::setInstanceCertificate() method.
	*
	* If a client likes to connect to a server the server instance certificate is provided in its EndpointDescription @see Application::getEndpointsFromServer().
	* The client application can validate this certificate using the Application::validateCertificate() method.
	* The OPC UA Toolkit performs no automatic validation.
	*
	* If a client opens a secure connection (Client::Session::connect()) with the server (i.e. if the clients requests messages to be signed
	* and/or encrypted), the provided client instance certificate is validated in the server automatically by the OPC UA Toolkit @see Application::setPkiStoreConfiguration().
	*
	* The validation of a certificate is done in the following steps:
	* @li The certificate must be a valid certificate (i.e. is conform to X509)
	* @li The certificate and all issuers up to the root are necessary to verify that the chain up to the root certificate is a valid chain.
	*     A valid chain does not necessarily imply a trusted certificate, it just ensures that all certificates are really signed by the named issuer.
	*     In case of a self-signed certificate the issuer is the certificate itself, i.e. it is a root certificate.
	* @li In case of revocation list validation the certificate must not be revoked by its issuer.
	*     There are multiple options how revocation list validation can be performed. see EnumCrlCheckOption
	* @li Additionally the certificate (or one of its issuer) must be recognized as a trusted certificate.
	*
	* Validation strategies:
	*
	* @li The strategy supported by earlier OPC UA Toolkit versions was to specify a list of trusted certificates only.
	*     In this list all trusted client certificates or the certificate of the issuer was stored, revocation list validation was not supported.
	*     To enabled this strategy the untrusted list can remain empty, the trusted list shall be added for chain validation and CRL validation shall be set to none.
	*     The check whether the certificate is in the trusted list can be skipped for performance reasons since only trusted certificates are added for chain validation.
	* @li Using the untrusted list for chain validation should imply the flag that one of the certificates in the chain must reside in the trusted list.
	*     Otherwise all certificates which pass the chain validation would be trusted.
	*     This strategy can be used if a global root certificate authority (CA) is used for signing certificates (or sub-CA).
	*     However it might be useful not trusting all other certificates signed by this global CA.
	* @li Certificate Revocation List (CRL) validation can be combined with any strategy.
	*     If a CRL validation of a specific certificate is performed the CRL of the issuer must be available, otherwise the validation fails. */
